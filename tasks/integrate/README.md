## Integration (1 POINT)

`scipy` `integrate` `quad` 

### Task

Use `scipy` to solve this assignment.

**`integrate_1`**:  
Implement a function that integrates a given function f(x) over the closed interval [0, 1] wrt. x.

```python
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**2
>>> integrate_1(f)
0.3333333333333333
```

### About the Task

You are **NOT** required to write your own numerical integration algorithm,
merely use existing function from `scipy` and rely on it, there is no need to
check that integral actually converges.

These tasks provide a practical introduction to numerical integration using `scipy`.
These techniques are widely used in scientific computing for solving various
mathematical problems.
